# Florence-2ner

A simple Florence-2 finetuning script

## Instructions

Requires a folder of images as well as captions in a txt file in the same folder. For now it needs both a `train` and `eval` subfolder.

```
dataset_folder
  -> train
    -> image1.jpg
    -> image1.txt
    -> blahbleh.webp
    -> blahbleh.txt
  -> eval
    -> asdfasdf.png
    -> asdfasdf.txt
    -> example file name here blah blah.jpeg
    -> example file name here blah blah.txt
```
